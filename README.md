# Movie Rating Prediction Project

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting movie ratings using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from IMDb (Internet Movie Database), specifically the 'IMDB-Movie-Data' dataset. The dataset includes various attributes of movies such as title, genre, year of release, runtime, rating, and number of votes.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately predict the rating of a movie based on its features. To achieve this, we will perform the following steps:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:**
   - Load the IMDb Movies dataset using pandas.
   - Explore basic information about the dataset including columns, data types, and summary statistics.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Convert necessary columns like 'Year' and 'Runtime (Minutes)' to numeric format for analysis.
   - Handle any missing values or outliers that may affect model performance.

3. **Feature Selection:**
   - Select relevant features that are likely to influence the movie ratings. This may include attributes such as 'Year', 'Runtime (Minutes)', 'Genre', and 'Votes'.

4. **Model Training:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to train the machine learning models.
   - Choose a suitable regression model (e.g., Linear Regression) for predicting movie ratings.
   - Train the model using the training dataset and evaluate its performance.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the trained model using appropriate metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess prediction accuracy.
   - Visualize model performance using plots like ROC curves or scatter plots to understand predictions.

6. **Prediction:**
   - Use the trained model to predict the rating for new or unseen movies.
   - Provide examples of how to input new movie features into the model for prediction.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python Libraries:** pandas, scikit-learn (sklearn), matplotlib, seaborn
- **Machine Learning Models:** Linear Regression (for regression tasks)

## Conclusion

This README provides an overview of the movie rating prediction project, outlining the steps involved from data loading to model training and prediction. It aims to demonstrate how machine learning can be leveraged to predict movie ratings based on historical data. Adjustments can be made to the model selection and features based on further analysis and domain knowledge.

## Future Improvements

- Explore more advanced regression models like Random Forest Regression or Gradient Boosting Regression for potentially better performance.
- Incorporate additional features such as director, actor, or production studio to enhance prediction accuracy.
- Implement cross-validation techniques to ensure the model's robustness and generalization capability.

## Usage
